## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a machine learning engineer focused on building efficient, interpretable, and reproducible machine learning pipelines using scikit-learn and Pandas. This project showcases a complete workflow for transforming raw data into deployable models, with a strong emphasis on data wrangling, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

The first stage of this pipeline involves extensive data preprocessing with Pandas. I perform cleaning, normalization, and transformation tasks such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, detecting outliers, and scaling features. This ensures the dataset is structured and consistentâ€”an essential foundation for reliable modeling.

Next comes feature engineering, where domain knowledge and exploratory analysis guide the creation of meaningful input variables. I demonstrate techniques like polynomial features, binning, one-hot encoding, and dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA) to improve model performance. Feature selection methods such as recursive feature elimination (RFE) and mutual information scores are also applied to reduce noise and improve generalization.

The core of the repository centers on building machine learning models using scikit-learnâ€™s pipeline API. I integrate preprocessing steps and estimators into end-to-end pipelines for classification and regression tasks. Each model is evaluated using cross-validation, learning curves, and performance metrics like accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and mean squared error, depending on the task. Hyperparameter tuning is handled via GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV for optimal performance.

This repository serves as a practical guide for building production-ready machine learning solutions. Whether you're preparing tabular data, selecting features, or fine-tuning models, this project demonstrates clean, reusable patterns for real-world machine learning using Python's most trusted libraries.
